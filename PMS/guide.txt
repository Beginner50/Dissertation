-------------------------------------- Introduction ---------------------------------------

The following document will serve as a guide for understanding the project.

The project will be divided into 2 parts:
    - client  (This will host the code pertinent to the website/interface including data access)
    - server  (This will host the code pertinent to the services as described in the UML design
               section, made accessible via REST apis)


DOCKER ORCHESTRATION:
For the sake of making deployment easy, Docker (w/ Docker Compose) will be used to host and
orchestrate the different components of the system (client, server, database) in one single
command. As such, no other configurations will be required when setting up the project in
another machine, be it windows or linux.

To run the website (production)
    docker compose --profiles production up

To run the tests
    docker compose --profiles test up


----------------------------------------- Client -------------------------------------------

The client facing part of the website will be made using React along with the following
dependencies listed below:
    - Typescript       (A superset of javascript that includes type safety to improve code
                        readability, maintenance and debugging)
    - Vite             (Provides a development server and bundler to convert the React code 
                        + Typescript code into javascript, which the web browser can understand)
    - Tanstack Router  (A routing library that allows for routing without resulting in a full 
                        page reload)
    - React Auth Kit   (An authentication library for abstracting the process of JWT authentication)
    - Material UI      (React UI library that provides components for structuring UI)

I will mainly elaborate on the src/ directory since the rest are essentially configuration files
for the package manager (npm) or code editor, and have little bearing on the project.

IMPORTANT FILES:
1) src/routes/
   Tanstack router uses file-based routing, and therefore the structure of the routes directory
   and a given route (page) within it reflects the url segment that it will take. For example,
    src/routes/index        -> http://website/
    src/routes/demo/        -> http://website/demo
    src/routes/demo/$id     -> http://website/demo/{id} (id can be any integer here)

    When building the project (npm run build), vite will analyse the routes directory and convert
    these file-based routes into actual routes in routeTree.gen.ts. The application will then only
    need to read routeTree.gen.ts

2) src/main.tsx
   This will be the entrypoint of the application and it serves 2 purposes:
   -  It creates the router and performs some configuration to make it type-safe.
   -  It will render the entire react application inside index.html 

3) index.html
    When hosting the application, the web server will only need to host this static index.html
    file. After building the application, it will contain the necessary scripts that will
    populate it with the elements from the React application

4) src/components
    This is the directory for storing the components of the application (used in the routes)

5) src/integrations
    This is a directory that connects external libraries with the React + Tanstack Router
    framework.


SPECIAL ROUTE FILES:
Tanstack file-based routing provides special files to allow users to define how the url segments
map to the each route file. The Tanstack Router documentation provides more information on this:
