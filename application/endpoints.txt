The bearer auth token will need to store:
	- UserID
	- Role
	- ProjectIDs
ProjectIDs to account for supervisors having multiple projects
New access token will need to be resent at project creation


Meeting Endpoints:
Authorization checks are performed at the controller/services level rather than at the middleware level.

Get supervisor's meetings:
	GET /meetings

	Standard auth check

Book a meeting:
	POST /projects/1/meetings
	
	ProjectID from params compared with that in access token

Edit a meeting's description:
	PATCH /projects/1/meetings/1

	ProjectID from bearer auth will be compared against that of the meeting before edit
	ProjecID is unique to a supervisor-student pair and therefore only allows them to edit.

Cancel a meeting:
	DELETE /meetings/1

	UserID from bearer auth is OrganizerID and will be checked for validity before proceding
	with meeting cancellation.

Accept a meeting:
	POST /meetings/1/accept

	UserID from bearer auth is AttendeeID and will be checked for validity before proceeding
	to accept meeting.

Reject a meeting:
	POST /meetings/1/reject

	UserID from bearer auth is AttendeeID and will be checked for validity before proceeding
	to reject meeting.

Postpone a meeting:
	POST /meetings/1/postpone

	UserID from bearer auth is AttendeeID and will be checked for validity before proceeding
	to postpone meeting.
